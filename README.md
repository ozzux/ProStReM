## Protein Structure Recognition Model

ProStreM is a neural network which determines a protein's structural class from its sequence.

## Steps to run ProStReM
1. Install Conda and winrar.
2. Create a Conda environment with Python version 3.9 using the following code `conda create --prefix ./_venv python=3.9`
4. Run `conda install tensorflow=2.10` and `pip install scikit-learn`
5. Use winrar to unzip the compressed model into the main folder.
